## 11. How do you inspect the logs of a Docker container?

### Explanation:
To view logs generated by a running or stopped container, Docker provides the `docker logs` command.

### Example Commands:
```bash
docker ps          # list running containers
docker logs <container_id>
docker logs -f <container_id>   # follow logs in real time
````

### Real-World Example:

In our Node.js container, we checked logs to identify startup issues:

```bash
docker logs -f nodeapp
```

It helped us find missing environment variables that caused the app to crash during deployment.

## 12. How do you access a running container’s shell?

### Explanation:

To interact directly with a running container, use the `docker exec` command with an interactive terminal.

### Example Commands:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```

If `bash` is unavailable, use:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> sh
```

### Real-World Example:

In our Tomcat container, we used `docker exec -it tomcat bash` to explore log files and modify configurations during testing.

## 13. What’s the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in a Dockerfile?

### Explanation:

Both define what runs when the container starts, but their behaviors differ.

| Instruction | Purpose         | Overridable                                |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| CMD         | Default command | Yes                                        |
| ENTRYPOINT  | Main executable | No (unless overridden with `--entrypoint`) |

### Example:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "app.py"]
CMD ["--help"]
```

### Real-World Example:

We used ENTRYPOINT to ensure the Python app always runs, and CMD to pass arguments dynamically (like `--debug` or `--port=8080`).

---

## 14. How do you restart a container automatically on failure?

### Explanation:

You can set a **restart policy** using the `--restart` flag when running containers.

### Example Commands:

```bash
docker run -d --restart=on-failure:3 myapp
docker run -d --restart=always myapp
```

### Real-World Example:

In our monitoring service, we used `--restart=always` so the container restarts automatically after server reboots or crashes.

---

## 15. How do you limit CPU and memory usage for a container?

### Explanation:

Docker provides resource control using the `--cpus` and `--memory` options.

### Example Commands:

```bash
docker run -d --name myapp --cpus="1.5" --memory="512m" myapp
```

### Real-World Example:

To prevent a buggy Node.js container from consuming excessive memory, we limited it to 512 MB and 1.5 CPU cores on our production host.

---

## 16. What is a bind mount and how does it differ from a volume?

### Explanation:

A **bind mount** links a directory from the **host machine** to the **container**.
A **volume** is managed by Docker and stored under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`.

### Example:

```bash
docker run -v /home/user/config:/app/config myapp
```

### Real-World Example:

During development, we used bind mounts to instantly reflect code changes from our host system inside containers, improving productivity.

---

## 17. What happens when a container is deleted? Is the data lost?

### Explanation:

By default, data stored inside a container is **deleted** when the container is removed.
However, if volumes or bind mounts are used, data persists.

### Example:

```bash
docker rm -f myapp   # container deleted
```

If data is in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`, it remains.

### Real-World Example:

We mapped our MySQL data to a volume `db_data`. Even after removing the container, the database files were intact and reusable.

---

## 18. What are Docker tags and how are they used in image management?

### Explanation:

Tags are labels attached to Docker images to differentiate versions.

### Example Commands:

```bash
docker build -t myapp:v1 .
docker tag myapp:v1 myrepo/myapp:v1.0.1
docker push myrepo/myapp:v1.0.1
```

### Real-World Example:

We maintained versions like `backend:v1`, `backend:v2`, etc.
Jenkins pipelines automatically tagged each build with the Git commit ID for traceability.

---

## 19. What is the difference between docker stop and docker kill?

### Explanation:

* `docker stop` gracefully stops a container by sending a SIGTERM signal, allowing cleanup.
* `docker kill` immediately stops a container using SIGKILL.

### Example Commands:

```bash
docker stop myapp
docker kill myapp
```

### Real-World Example:

We used `docker stop` during maintenance to allow the application to close DB connections cleanly.
`docker kill` was used only when a container became unresponsive.

---

## 20. How do you clean up unused images and containers?

### Explanation:

Over time, unused containers, images, and volumes consume space. Docker provides cleanup commands.

### Example Commands:

```bash
docker system prune
docker container prune
docker image prune -a
docker volume prune
```

### Real-World Example:

Before every Jenkins build, we cleaned old dangling images to save disk space on our build servers.
